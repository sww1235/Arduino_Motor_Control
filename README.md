# Arduino_Motor_Control

This is some simple code to control a pan/tilt camera mount using a 2 poteniometer joystick. 

This allows for use of potentiometers without a deadzone in the middle, where the center 
reading is half of the nominal voltage.

Also includes a fritzing schematic of the setup used.
